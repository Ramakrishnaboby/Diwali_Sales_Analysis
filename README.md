## Introduction
The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the sales data during the Diwali season. By examining various factors such as age group, gender, state, and occupation, the project seeks to uncover trends and provide actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies in future festive seasons.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains over 11,000 entries with the following key columns:
- *User_ID*: Unique identifier for each customer
- *Cust_name*: Customer name
- *Product_ID*: Unique identifier for each product
- *Gender*: Gender of the customer
- *Age Group*: Age group of the customer
- *State*: State from which the purchase was made
- *Occupation*: Occupation of the customer
- *Product_Category*: Category of the purchased product
- *Orders*: Number of orders placed
- *Amount*: Total amount spent on the purchase

## Analysis
The analysis involves the following key steps:
1. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing*: Addressed missing values, corrected data types, and removed irrelevant columns.
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Analyzed sales data based on demographic factors and identified key patterns.
3. *Sales Segmentation*: Segmented data by gender, age group, and other factors to find trends in consumer behavior.
4. *Correlation Analysis*: Examined correlations between different variables to uncover relationships.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to better understand the data:
- *Sales by Age Group*: Bar charts to show which age groups spend the most.
- *Sales by Gender*: Pie charts and bar charts to compare male vs. female spending.
- *Sales by State and Occupation*: Heatmaps to show which states and occupations contribute the most to sales.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key insights:
- Certain age groups, particularly 26-35, are more active in making purchases during Diwali.
- There are notable differences in spending between male and female customers.
- Some states and occupations show higher sales, indicating potential target markets for future campaigns.
